# Project Proposal for BLAH 7

Project title: Biomedically oriented automatically annotated Twitter COVID-19 Dataset

Taking advantage of having in-house one of the largest Twitter COVID-19 chatter datasets (https://zenodo.org/record/4295939), in this project we will incorporate current best-practices and novel approaches to attribute relevance, remove bots/spam, handle misspellings and colloquialisms in Twitter data, in order to potentially identify Tweets with self-reported symptoms/drug usage with clinical characterization relevance. The product of this project would be an automatically annotated dataset (probably using medaCy (https://github.com/NLPatVCU/medaCy), medSpacy (https://github.com/medspacy/medspacy) and SciSpacy). We will release tweet identifiers and all annotations made for English language. The bigger picture behind this project is to create a framework to pre-process Twitter data to extract clinical insights in a, preferably, automated way, generating large annotated datasets along the way. We will use and expand the tools available in the Social Media Mining Toolkit (SMMT) developed during BLAH6 for this task, and will provide all annotations in brat and PubAnnotation formats. 

For evaluation, we have a manually annotated set that we will be using for a SMM4H 2021  shared task that we can use for evaluation of the proposed approach.
